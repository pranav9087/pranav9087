# Hey there! 👋 I'm Pranav 🚀 | 🛠️ Engineer | 🎮 Tech Explorer | 🧑‍💻 Builder of Cool Things  

I’m the kind of person who hears *“It can’t be done”* and takes it as a challenge. Whether it’s writing keyloggers in Python 🐍, crafting Pong with hand-tracking 🎾, or teaching Jetson Nano to sort trash 🗑️ – I love mixing tech with creativity!  

**🔧 Tech Stack:** Python, JavaScript, Dart | Flask, Django, React, Flutter | Jetson Nano, ESP32-S3  

**🎯 Projects I'm Proud Of:**  
- **CryptoAlpha 🔮** – Predicts crypto prices like a digital fortune teller.  
- **Seeker 🍕** – Connects students to clubs because *no one should miss pizza night!*  
- **MusicECG 🎵** – Turns heartbeats into beats.  
- **VirtualPong ✋🎮** – Play Pong with your hands… no controller needed!  
- **SegBin ♻️** – AI-driven waste sorter that makes trash sorting smarter.  

**✨ Fun Fact:** I once built a project just because someone said *“It’s impossible.”*
