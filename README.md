# Hey there! 👋 I'm Pranav 🚀  

### 🛠️ Engineer | 🎮 Tech Explorer | 🧑‍💻 Builder of Cool Things  

I’m the kind of person who hears *“It can’t be done”* and takes it as a challenge. Whether it’s writing keyloggers in Python 🐍, crafting Pong with hand-tracking 🎾, or teaching Jetson Nano to sort trash 🗑️ – I love mixing tech with creativity!  

### 🔧 My Playground (Tech Stack):  
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, Dart  
- **Frameworks:** Flask, Django, React, Flutter  
- **Favorite Toys:** Jetson Nano, ESP32-S3  
- **Special Power:** Teaching machines to *feel* emotions (via ECG data 😄💓)  

### 📚 Projects I'm Proud Of:  
- **CryptoAlpha** – Predicts crypto prices like a digital fortune teller.  
- **Seeker** – Connects students to clubs because *no one should miss pizza night!* 🍕  
- **MusicECG** – Turns heartbeats into beats 🎵.  
- **VirtualPong** – Play Pong with your hands… no controller needed! ✋🎮  
- **SegBin** – AI-driven waste sorter that makes trash sorting smarter. ♻️  

### 🎯 What I’m Up To:  
- Making machines understand humans better (one emotion at a time).  
- Adding random Easter eggs to my code 🥚.  
- Building an AI that tells dad jokes.  

### ✨ Fun Fact:  
I once built a project just because someone said *“It’s impossible.”*
